# Zephyr Route Library (WIP)
**This library is currently Work in Progress (WIP)**

Zephyr Route is a high-performance and memory-safe packet parsing library for routing protocols like BGP, OSPF and RIP. This is an experiment to implement such old protocols in modern languages.

## General Support
This library supports multiple features and protocols and here is just a simple enumeration of them:
- Both IPv4 and IPv6 (Internet Protocol Version 4 and 6)
- The Border Gateway Protocol (BGP/EGP/IGP)
- Open Shortest Path First Protocol (OSPF/IGP)

## Protocols implemented
The zephyr routing library implement a bunch of routing protocols. Here can you see a list of all protocols which are
implemented by this library.
- [X] BGP (Not fully)
- RIP?
- OSPF?
